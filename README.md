# Student Performance Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict student performance using machine learning techniques. It includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and logging functionalities.

## Components

### 1. Data Injection
- **SQL Database**: The project utilizes SQL for data storage and retrieval. It connects to a database to fetch the necessary data for analysis.

### 2. Data Transformation
- **Preprocessing Module**: Includes scripts for cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for model training.

### 3. Model Training
- **Machine Learning Models**: Various machine learning algorithms are implemented for predicting student performance. These models are trained using the preprocessed data.

### 4. Evaluation
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the performance of the trained models.

### 5. Logs
- **Logs Folder**: Contains logs of model training, evaluation, and any errors encountered during the process.

### 6. Custom Exception Handling
- **CustomException.py**: Defines custom exceptions to handle specific errors encountered during runtime.

### 7. Utils
- **Utils.py**: Contains utility functions used across different modules of the project.
